Just copy to your home directory.

Some cool stuff that I can think of right now:
,vi opens your vimrc
,t opens new tab
,s opens new split

Arrow keys do not work, they will remove whitespace above (^) indent (>,<) and
insert whitespace above (V). This is so that you get good at VIM!

run ':BundleInstall' from within vim to get any missing packages using Vundle

It's bedtime but I'll update this soon enough.
